Ball Aerospace's COSMOS Ground Station GUI for INSPIRESat-1.

The INSPIRESat-1 is a nanosatellite from the International Space Program In Research and Education (INSPIRE) Educate to promote cultural exchanges through international collaborative space science and spacecraft engineering projects. It consists of 2 Payloads:

1) Compact Ionospheric Probe (CIP): To improve the understanding of Ionosphere dynamics through observations of ion temperature, composition, density, and velocity by Compact Ionosphere Probe (CIP).
2) Dual Aperture X-ray Solar Spectrometer (DAXSS): To improve our understanding of the sunâ€™s coronal heating processes by measuring the Soft X-Ray spectrum of the sun.
